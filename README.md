# Seizure-Security-System
A program created to track if a person has a seizure or not
Motion.py file - used to test in any room, for my idea, this will be used in the bedroom, if movement is detected (the child wakes up), a ring will be played so the caregiver will know that the child has awaken and can get to him
SoundLevelDetect.py - used in the bedroom as well, determines noise level in the room. If noise level is high, it may indicate something wrong with the child, and then an alarm will sound.                                                                                                                      *Note: this mistake will later on be corrected when I make the program identify and detect seizure sounds instead of simply determining noise level.
